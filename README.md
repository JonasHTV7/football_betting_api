# football_betting_api
**A program designed to predict and bet on football (soccer) matches using halftime results**

***This program requires the pandas module to run, if you do not have it you can install it with an installer such as pip using the command "pip3 install pandas" if on python 3. It also requires the builtin time module, but this module is only used to check how long a full run of the program takes.***

Please remember that all betting in any forms involves risk. Be aware and accept this risk before using this program for any kind of betting. Never bet with money you cannot afford to lose. No "safe" betting system has ever been devised and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. No representation is being made that any user will achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed in commits or any other description.
